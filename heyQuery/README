heyQuery is a light wrapper around jQuery's Sizzle selector engine, meant to provide
just enough capability to do the XML extraction we use in our JS-based code for the
StatusNet client.

Stock jQuery 1.4.2 doesn't work in Titanium Mobile 1.3 due to a combination of bugs
in Titanium's Ti.XML implementation, legitimately missing functionality that's not
firmly specced but that jQuery/Sizzle expect, and other assumptions made about the
environment that don't hold (such as type checks based on the output of toString()).

Not everything is working yet; the biggest remaining hurdle I've found is that object
identity is not preserved for the proxied DOM node objects; this makes it impossible
to test whether two variables refer to the same node, breaking many test cases including
descendent and adjacent selectors.


Sizzle is from: http://sizzlejs.com/ and has all that copyright stuff. Enjoy!



Other fixes that should be done:
* loading sizzle.js still requires a funky wrapper check, should be cleaned up.
* probably have heyQuery.js load sizzle.js, or combine them.
