It would be good if we can have separate app icons for iPhone and Android:

iPhone needs an icon which fills the entire area due to it not allowing transparency...
A glossy finish, rounded corners, and black background (if transparency) are
automatically added.

Android allows and encourages transparency in app icons, and adds no texture.

For now, we're using a compromise icon that has a rounded solid gradient background,
which looks sorta ok on both.



Android is also scaling our large app icon down very badly, while things look ok
on iPhone.
