# Tweetanium

Tweetanium was one of the first reference applications for the Titanium Desktop SDK.  Based on the
awesome work of the Titanium development team and community, I figured it was time to bring it back
for both desktop and mobile.  We'll see where the project goes - maybe some people will like it 
enough to use it?  In any case, it will serve as a good example for folks looking to build desktop
and mobile apps with Titanium.
